# Singer

Singer enables you to make a custom website for your album, including a music
player with configurable content, all hosted for free by [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/)
and powered by your existing <a href="https://soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a> account.

You don't need to be technical to set it up.

## Demo

A live example of what it looks like is located at [aminoctu.com](http://aminoctu.com), and
the source can be found at [github.com/pearkes/aminoctu.com](https://github.com/pearkes/aminoctu.com).

This demo, and my friend who makes that music, spurred creation of this project.

## Setting It Up

Follow the [Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md).

If you're technical and don't like step-by-step guides, just check
out the [`_config.yml`](_config.yml) file.
